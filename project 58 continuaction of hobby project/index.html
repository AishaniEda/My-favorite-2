        <p> Reading is a good hobby that will not only improve your imagination but also allows you to escape your daily routine. When you read a good book you can really get lost in the story. A book gives you the chance to escape your daily reality and experience a whole new world! When I am bored I can read, books are interesting improve vocabulary are so much more! That is why I love to read a lot and I do it all the time!
